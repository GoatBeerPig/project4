This project was significantly harder for me than the other 3 which shows in lack of content.

I tried to make addUser and updateUser work with user inputted data, but didn't get it working, so the values are set in the backend
To addUser I tried something like http://localhost:3000/api/add?name="+name+"&email="+email but always only added the id while email and user were blank. Also tried other methods I found on the internet but they returned the same result also

I also never got the search function to work so that isn't in the app either

I spent a lot of time trying to get these ones to work so I in the end I lacked time and motivation to do relevant styling and making the app more distinct from the example app in the modules
